# SDV601-Playground
Code playground for NMIT SDV601 C# course.

This repository does not run, it is purely for storing and showing my learning and notes from classes. Due to the nature and structure of C# projects, it is easier to run each new practice program in the same Visual Studio project and record the code in this separate repository.
